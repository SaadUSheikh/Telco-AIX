# Telecom AI Agent Framework

A cloud-native framework for autonomous network management through cooperating AI agents that detect, diagnose, plan, and resolve telecom network issues without human intervention. 

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Traditional network management requires human operators to:
1. Monitor for issues
2. Diagnose root causes
3. Plan remediation
4. Execute changes
5. Verify solutions

The Telecom AI Agent Framework automates this entire workflow through specialized AI agents that work together to maintain network health autonomously, reducing downtime and operational costs.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Network Management**: End-to-end automation from detection to resolution
- **Specialized Agent Types**: Four agent types that perform distinct roles:
  - **Diagnostic Agents**: Monitor telemetry and detect anomalies
  - **Planning Agents**: Generate remediation plans for detected issues
  - **Execution Agents**: Apply configuration changes to network elements
  - **Validation Agents**: Verify that issues have been resolved
- **Communication Infrastructure**:
  - **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Standardized context sharing between agents
  - **Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)**: Direct agent-to-agent messaging
- **Orchestration Layer**: Coordinates workflow execution and agent activities
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Visualize agent activities, network telemetry, and workflow status
- **Cloud-Native Design**: Built following 12-factor app methodology

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/open-experiments/Telco-AIX.git
cd Telco-AIX/agentic

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install WebSocket support (required for agent communication)
pip install websockets
```

### Running the Framework

To start the framework with the full agent ecosystem and dashboard:

```bash
python main.py --run-test
```

This will:
1. Start the MCP server, ACP broker, and dashboard server
2. Create and initialize all four agent types
3. Register agents with the orchestration service
4. Create a sample workflow
5. Run a test scenario that demonstrates the complete anomaly detection and resolution process

Then open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

You'll see the dashboard with real-time visualization of agent activities, network telemetry, and workflow status.

### Command Line Options

- `--mcp-host`: Host address for the MCP server (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `--mcp-port`: Port for the MCP server (default: 8000)
- `--acp-host`: Host address for the ACP broker (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `--acp-port`: Port for the ACP broker (default: 8002)
- `--dashboard-host`: Host address for the dashboard (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `--dashboard-port`: Port for the dashboard (default: 8080)
- `--run-test`: Execute a test network anomaly scenario

## Dashboard Only Mode

If you want to see just the dashboard visualization without the agent communications:

```bash
python dashboard_mode.py
```

This runs a simplified version with simulated data that demonstrates what the system looks like when operational.

## Architecture

The framework is built around these core components:

1. **Agent Core Framework**
   - Base agent abstractions with lifecycle management
   - Protocol implementations (MCP, ACP)
   - Context assembly and management

2. **Specialized Agents**
   - Network Diagnostic Agent: Monitors telemetry for anomalies
   - Planning Agent: Generates solutions for identified issues
   - Execution Agent: Implements planned solutions
   - Validation Agent: Verifies solution effectiveness

3. **Communication Protocols**
   - Model Context Protocol (MCP): Context sharing with headers, metadata, and payloads
   - Agent Communication Protocol (ACP): Direct agent-to-agent messaging

4. **Orchestration Service**
   - Agent discovery and registration
   - Workflow management
   - Task decomposition
   - Resource allocation

5. **Dashboard Server**
   - Real-time visualization of network telemetry
   - Agent status monitoring
   - Workflow progress tracking
   - Event timeline display

## How It Works: Network Anomaly Resolution

This framework implements autonomous network issue resolution through the following workflow:

1. **Detect**: Diagnostic Agent continuously monitors telemetry data and detects network anomalies (e.g., high packet loss)
2. **Share Context**: Anomaly details are stored in MCP with relevant metrics and telemetry
3. **Notify**: Diagnostic Agent notifies Planning Agents via ACP
4. **Plan**: Planning Agent generates a resolution plan based on the context
5. **Execute**: Execution Agent implements the solution (e.g., routing updates, config changes)
6. **Validate**: Validation Agent verifies the issue is resolved

The entire workflow is managed by the orchestration service, which ensures proper sequencing and handles errors or timeouts.

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Connection Issues

If you see errors like:
```
WARNING: No supported WebSocket library detected
```

Install the required WebSocket support:
```bash
pip install websockets
```

### Agent Communication Errors

If agents cannot communicate with each other:
1. Ensure the ACP broker is running
2. Confirm there are no firewall rules blocking the ports
3. Verify all services are using the correct host/port configurations

## Extending the Framework

### Creating a New Agent Type

1. Create a new class extending the appropriate base agent type:

```python
from agent.base import PlanningAgent

class CustomPlanningAgent(PlanningAgent):
    async def _initialize(self) -> None:
        # Custom initialization logic
        pass
        
    async def _run(self) -> None:
        # Custom processing logic
        pass
        
    async def _shutdown(self) -> None:
        # Custom shutdown logic
        pass
        
    async def generate_plan(self, problem_context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Planning logic
        return {"plan": "..."}
```

2. Register the agent with the orchestration service

### Creating a New Workflow Type

Extend the orchestration service with a new workflow implementation:

```python
async def _execute_custom_workflow(self, workflow: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    # Implement workflow steps
    pass
```
