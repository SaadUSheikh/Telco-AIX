## Metric file processing
It starts with a processing a telecom metric files for AMF, SMF and UPF<br>

## Anomaly detection
It uses a machine learning model for anomaly detection by using simple isolation forest algorithm.

## Root Cause Analysis 
After detection of the anomalies -> builds a VectorDB with Logs and finds assocated data pieces inside -> Passes to GenAI model that provides and RCA accrodingly<br>

## Example Test Output
Root Cause Analysis:<br>

```
Based on the provided system logs and alerts, the anomalies in the metrics can be attributed to several issues affecting different components of the system. 

1. Registration Storm: Both the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) and Session Management Function (SMF) were affected by a registration storm. This is a situation where a large number of devices attempt to register with the network simultaneously, causing a surge in registration rate. This can lead to increased CPU and memory utilization as the system tries to process the high volume of registration requests. 

2. Resource Exhaustion: Both the User Plane Function (UPF) and SMF experienced resource exhaustion. This indicates that these components were running out of resources, likely due to high demand. This can be seen in the increased CPU and memory utilization metrics for these components. 

3. Session Management Failure: The AMF, SMF, and UPF all experienced session management failures. This suggests that there were issues with establishing, maintaining, or terminating sessions. This could be due to a variety of reasons, including network congestion, software bugs, or hardware failures. 

4. Latency: The UPF experienced increased latency, as indicated by the 'True' value in the 'latency_ms' column of the anomalies table. This could be a result of the aforementioned issues, as increased CPU and memory utilization, as well as session management failures, can all contribute to increased latency. 

In conclusion, the root cause of the anomalies appears to be a combination of a registration storm, resource exhaustion, and session management failures, all of which led to increased CPU and memory utilization and increased latency. Further investigation would be needed to determine the exact cause of these issues and to develop appropriate solutions.
